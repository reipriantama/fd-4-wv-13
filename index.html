          The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the
          only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly
          referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from
          the wild members of the family.

          The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the
          domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the
          modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first
          species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago
          before the development of agriculture.
